# FlowMeterApp - back-end

FlowMeterApp is an web application that allows to integrate dedicated flow measurement device with a database and easily manage the measurements with simple and convenient interface for the user.

This repository is back-end of the FlowMeterApp. It is written in C# with ASP.NET Web API technology. To integrate with dababase (MSSQL Server) we used Entity Framework Core.

Our application allows user to:
- start new measurement
- see the current measurement values in numbers and graphs
- control of increased flows
- archive and view reports from previous measurements
